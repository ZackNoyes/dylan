			<p id="small">Updated Pong App - 12/01/2018</p>
			<p>
				I have added quite a few tweaks to my Pong app to make it better and easier to use! The updates include fixing the bouncing, user interface upgrades and better customiseablity. Now whenever the ball bounces on a paddle, depending on where the ball hits on the paddle the 
				ball will bounce off at different angles, making the game more like the origional version. For example if the ball hits the edge of the paddle, the ball will go off at a shallower angle whilst if the ball hits the middle it will go straight ... <a href="pong.html">Read More</a>

			<h1>Pong! <span class="tag is-rounded">Project</span> <span class="tag ">App</span></h1>
			<p id="small">My First (half decent) App! - 06/01/2018</p>
			<p>
				Happy new year! I deceided to celebrate by learning swift and making some random apps! Pong is my first (half decent) app, featuring a fully working pong app with extra settings to make it even better! You can set the speed of the ball to vary the difficulty and features such as a customiseable paddle color, paddle size and different modes are coming soon! The app is currently not available on the app store,
				but may be added soon. The app uses physics to determine where the ball should go after colliding with a paddle and runs smootly. If you are interested in aquiring a copy of the app please <a href="index.html#contact">contact me</a>.

			<h1>Random Products <span class="tag ">Game</span><span class="tag ">Website</span></h1>
			<p id="small">A javascript game - 22/12/2017</p>
			<p>
				Random Products is currently a unique Beta game. The game selects a random product from a list and then pixelises the image. The job of the user is to guess what the product is. If you guess the product incorrectly, the image becomes less pixleised and easier to guess but you get less points. If you guess incorrectly 3 times, you lose a life and you have 
				three lives in the game. The game is currently not hosted anywhere although I intend to host it when I add more products.

			<h1>Hangman <span class="tag is-rounded">Project</span> <span class="tag ">Game</span></h1>
			<p id="small">A javascript game - 02/12/2017</p>
			<p>
				Hangman is a fun game with different levels of difficulty. There are three diferent levels of difficulty which change how difficult the word is and how many lives you get. There is also a cool balloon animation and if you get a letter incorrect you lose a balloon, if you lose all balloons you die and fall into the shark below.
				The game is currently in Beta, with a very basic word list and animations. If you are interested in making a word list / helping me out please let me know by contacting me <a href="index.html#contact">(contact me)</a>! In future updates I will add catergories and hints for the words.

				The typing game is a game to test your typing speed. Words fall down from the top of the screen and you have to type them before they reach the bottom. There are easy and hard words and as you level up you get more hard words. As you level up the speed of new words and the speed of the words moving down the page increases. 
				When I next update the game it will include the ability to have your own custom word lists to play with and I will add more words to the defualt list. The game can be used to practice spelling, learn new words and to practice your typing speed!

			<p id="small">HTML / CSS / JS / Swift Development - 19/8/2017</p>
			<p>Transport Transfer was an app created to help people to decide what mode of transport to take. It is designed to be easy to use,
				and visually appealing. The app uses government data to determine which form of transport is quickest to take to a certain destination.
				The transport types include public transport such as busses, walking, driving and cycling. The app takes into account weather data as well to
				determine whether you can ride or walk. The app is not currently on the app store.
