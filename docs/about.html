					<p>
						I am an Australian high school student currently styding maths, science, english, PE, RaVE, chinese and IT. I have been learning IT since the start of 2017 and have so far managed to create numerous good looking websites and apps. For
						those of you who can speak chinese, 你好！我叫带兰！我不好说汉语！For anyone who google translated that, my name isn't blue but the pinyin (how a word is pronounced) for "blue" is dai lan which is as close as you will get to Dylan. Its actually kinda interesting
						because the character 带 means to bring and 兰 means orchid. Last time I checked to bring an orchand doesn't mean blue but I guess whatever floats your boat.
					</p> 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>
						In my spare time I enjoy to play a few games, play sport and code random stuff. I enjoy sport and competitively play soccer, (field) hockey and chess (yes its actaully a sport). I am a pretty good hockey and chess player having
						represented my state in both the sports.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>
						I am always open to feedback, feedback from people usually makes things better and in my experiance lots of people underrate it! I enjoy a good joke (who doesn't?) and I always try to be entertaining when playing sports, the more exciting it is the more fun eh?

						San Francisco Trip
					</h2>
					<p>
						Recently I went on a school trip traveling to San Francisco and Silicon Valley visiting all the tech companies. Not only did we manage to visit many high-profile companies we were also lucky enough to go inside the companies and get talks from some of the senior people in the companies, for example we got to speak to Dave Hits, the founder of a multi-billion dollar company NetApp. The opportunity was amazing to be able to travel to so many high profile companies,
						and it provided invaluable experiance and insider knowledge. You can read more about it by clicking <a href="blog/sanfran.html">here</a> . I found that being part of such an amazing trip really opened my eyes to be able to see what I am working towards in life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To keep up to date on what I do and a bunch of other stuff, visit my <a href="blog/blog.html">blog</a> page. To chill out and try your luck at my games visit my <a href="tools.html">tools</a> page (yes I know that games arn't really associated with tools, but I couldn't be botherd to put a games link in my menu,
						plus the menu would be too full).
