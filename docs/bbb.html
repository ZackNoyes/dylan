							<p>Today we got up early to go to Google! We started off by visitng the Android Sculpture Garden and the Google Merchandise Store.</p>
							<img src="images1/sculpture.jpg">
							<small>Above: Google Sculpture Garden</small>
							<p>
								After finishing up at the store we headed off to meet our guide. We were then taken for a tour of the campus and had lunch at Cafe Charlie, the main cafe at Google HQ.
							</p>
							<img src="images1/googleoutside.jpg">
							<small>Above: Google campus</small>
							<p>
								After having lunch we then went into a Machine Learning workshop where we learnt about and worked with Googles own Machine Learning engine, Tensor Flow. We learnt how to train the machine to recognies numbers by traning it using a set of images. We also learnt how to make the machine do the work for us with parabolic equations, where the machine would train itself to make the parabola as close to the data points as possible, getting better each time untill it cannot be any better. 
							</p>
							<img src="images1/google.jpg">
							<small>Above: Google</small>
							<p>
								The ML workshop was really interesting, being able to visulise the machine getting better by teaching itself. After the ML workshop we went over to the GBike workshop where the Google bikes are made, maintained and tracked. It was really interesting to see how far away some of the google bikes were taken. 
								<img src="images1/store.jpg">
								<small>Above: Google Store</small>
							<p>
								We all had a great day at Google, and afterwards we headed off to Lazer Quest to play four games of Lazer Tag. Just incase you were wondering I came first in 3/4 and third in the other game.

								Today we started off by travelling to NetApp HQ and having breakfast with their founder and CEO Dave Hitz. Dave gave an insightful presentation into NetApp as well as talking to us about the future plans for his company. It was really interesting how he spoke about what direction his company is trying to take to survive in the rapidly evolving Cloud world.
							</p>
							<img src="images1/netapp.jpg">
							<small>Above: NetApp HQ</small>
							<p>
								We also had several talks with senior people in NetApp who provided really good industry insights. They told us a lot about how they are trying to evolve the company to avoid it dying due to the recent Cloud companies such as AWS driving them out of business. NetApp was really interesting, and hopefully, they will manage to survive against the big Cloud companies.
							</p>
							<p>
								After visiting NetApp we went to Elastic. Elastic is a software company that specialises in data management and visualisation. They provide tools such as Elastic Search which is opensource which allows users to have a search engine that sorts through their data by the most relevant item.
							</p>
							<img src="images1/elastic.jpg">
							<small>Above: Elastic</small>
							<p>
								At Elastic, they did "Lightning Talks" which involved around 6 talks by different people in the company who talked about their area of expertise and how they all came to the company. The talks were very interesting and provided us with lots of tips and tricks that could possibly help us in the future. 
							</p>
							<img src="images1/elastic1.jpg">
							<small>Above: NetApp HQ</small>
							<p>
								After finishing up at Elastic we headed back to our hotel and ordered Uber Eats for dinner. After dinner, we started getting ready for tomorrows visit to Google!

								Today we had a rather restful day by biking around the Golden Gate Bridge in the morning and having free time to explore the city in the afternoon. The bike tour of the Golden Gate Bridge was fun although my back wheel popped out whilst on the bridge. 
							</p>
							<p >
								In the afternoon we went for a walk along Fisherman's Warf, buying lunch and visiting some stores. We then walked to Union Square and explored for a while. After visiting the Square, we headed towards Gotts Roadside for dinner. We all had a rather relaxing day preparing for the rest of the company visits to come!

							<p>Today we were off to Amazon to learn about their Web Services and visit the Amazon Fulfilment Center. After Arriving we were given breakfast and bussed off to the Fulfilment Center. At the Fulfilment Center we got a tour of the whole building.</p>
							<img src="images1/amazonLego.JPG">
							<small>Amazon Lego Figure</small>
							<p>
								Sadly we were unable to take any photos of the actual warehouse. Inside the warehouse was lots of conveyer belts which acted as a transport system for the boxed between different stages. There were also around 6000 Amazon Robots which brought the storage shelfs from the storage area to the pickers who then filled orders by getting the items and placing them in tubs which were sent on the conveyer belts to the other sections. After being separated into individual orders they were then put down slides and packed into trucks. The whole system was super cool.
							</p>
							<img src="images1/fulfilmentcenter.JPG">
							<small>Above: Amazon Fulfilment Center</small>
							<p>
								After our tour, we were shuttled back to the Amazon building and talked to by 3 speakers. The speakers talked about the different parts of AWS (amazon web services) and gave us an overview of the company. After the talks we went to the Amazon Go store which is a brand new "Supermarket" that is fully automated, you only need to have an account and grab an item off the shelf for it to be charged to you.

							<p>Today after getting up at 4am to travel to Seattle we spent our day at Microsoft. Microsoft has a massive campus, with about 20 buildings and over 10,000 employees on campus. </p>
							<img src="images/microsoft.JPG">
							<small>Above: Microsoft</small>
							<p>
								Once we got our badges we were shown around Microsoft's design area, where the designers came up with new designs to improve the UI of the Xbox shop, the Microsoft shop and all of their other platforms and products.
							</p>
							<p>
								After our tour, we were shown to a couple of other places and talked to by the software engineers that work on Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. Once the talks concluded we went to "The Commons" which is where they have cafes and food places where all the Microsoft employees go to get lunch.
							</p>
							<img src="images/commons.JPG">
							<small>Above: "The Commons"</small>

								Because we were able to see quite a few things at Microsoft that are still under development, such as new updates to certain software, we were unable to take many photos of the insides of buildings.

							<p>Today we were visiting two rather secretive companies, in both companies we were unable to take photos, and in Palantir we had to sign a NDA (non disclosure agreement). Because of this, I can't say too much or post any photos.</p>
							<p>
								At Palantir, we were looked after very well, and lots of the information they shared and the things they told us were relevant and very interesting. The staff that were showing us around were awesome and we all had an amazing time.
							</p>
							<p>
								After our visit of Palantir we went to SSL. For those that don't know SSL manufactures satellites and currently has 80+ GEO Stationary satellites in operation. The trip to SSL was really interesting and we learnt lots about the manufacturing process and how they do things as a company.

							<p>Today we once again woke up early to get to Silicon Valley and to visit Facebook. Upon arrival we all checked in at Facebook HQ on our Facebook accounts. We were then greeted by some very senior software engineers. </p>
							<img src="images/facebook.JPG">
							<small>Above: Facebook</small>
							<p>
								The engineers were amazing and gave us inside knowledge about Facebook and the Valley in general. We were also lucky enough to meet the former White House Chiefs of Technology and get talks from very senior facebook software engineers.
							</p>
							<p>
								After visiting Facebook we went to Apple (1 Inifinite Loop) and went to the Developer Relations Briefing Center. At the center we demonstrated our latest apps to an apple staff and visited the store.
							</p>
							<img src="images/appleI.JPG">
							<small>Above: Apple (1 Infinite Loop)</small>
							<p>
								After our trip to the 1 Infinite Loop campuses we went over to Apples new campus, Apple Park. Although not being allowed inside the actual building we went to the visitors center and talked to a senior developer on the Photos App. He gave us useful insights to how Apple operates and other interesting information.
							</p>
							<img src="images/applePark.JPG">

								Another cool thing was the Augmented Reality - Apple had made their own Augumented Reality app that would run and use the model of apple park and make it interactive by viewing it through an Ipad.

								After being briefed at ServiceNow about all of their services we had lunch and moved on to Mozilla. At Mozilla we were given a tour of their Mountain View offices (which are so cool!), and checked out the ball pit.

								After our tour we went to work solving bugs on the Mozilla bug software called Bugzilla. We all managed to solve several bugs and submit patches to the repository!

								The Computer History Museum was awesome, they had everything there from an Apple 1 to self driving cars. The displays were pretty interactive and it was a lovely building

							<p>Today we started off by going on the 'basic' Segway tour of San Fran. After learning how to use them we were guided through the maze of streets, stopping at an Italian bakery for some focaccia and the arcade at Fisherman's Wharf.</p>

								In the afternoon we were scheduled to go on the Alcatraz Night Tour but due to the government shutdown, our tour was cancelled. Although we were disappointed we were able to do some sightseeing along Bay 39 at Fisherman's Wharf.

							<p>Today we visited the Qantas Jet Base! We were lucky enough to see the models where they practice emergency procedures with the crew.</p>

								We were also lucky enough to be able to go inside a flight simulator! The vision inside the simulator is amazing and extremely realistic!

							<p>
								Afterwards we went to see the practice simulators which just have the computer screens and controls, but no movement or vision. These simulators are used to practice procedures and for pilots to get a feel of where everything is around the flight deck. After our visit at the Jet Base, we went to the 
								food center where all the food for Qantas flights that go into Sydney is prepared. They also prepare food for other airlines. The facility is pretty cool, and there are strict regulations to keep all the food safe.
							</p>
							<p>
								After our visit to the Qantas facilities concluded, we boarded our plane and arrived at SFO International Airport. Before we exited the plane, we were invited up to the flight deck by the captain and we were able to get photos and see all the controls of the plane which was an awesome opportunity. Because of the timezone difference, we actually make up a day and although we left on the 19th, it is still the 19th in America. Stay tuned for more updates!
