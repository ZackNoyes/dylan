								    For those who don't know what WWDC is, its Apple's World Wide Developers Conference which is held every year. You can view apples website about the conference <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">here</a>.

								<p>This year I decided to apply for a scholarship to WWDC which would provide my lodging, ticket cost and also a 1 year Apple developer licence allowing me to put apps on the app store.</p>

								<p>The application process was pretty hard, we had just over two weeks to create a swift playground that showcased our ingenuity. We had to try to use the latest apple technology to make something that would wow the judges. You can see exactally what we had to do and all the terms <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/">here</a>. For my application I decided to make a cool platformer. The platformer involved controlling a person and walking through and interacting with a world. I may update this with further information regarding my application later.</p>

								<p>After submitting the application and a 20 day wait we were informed if our application was successfull. I was lucky enough to be one of the few people who were accepted from around the world! Just to give you an idea of how tough the competition is, last year there were around 350 scholars from over 50 different countries.</p>

								<p> I will be updating this thread with information regarding the conference and also during the conference updating this as well. </p>
