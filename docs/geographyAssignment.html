						<h3 class="subtitle">Social Indicators</h3>
						<br/>
						<h3>Physicians per 1000 people</h3> 
						<p>This is a measure of how many physicians there are per 1000 people in the country. The more physicians a country has the better as access to doctors and medical treatment is easy and treatment usually good which creates a healthier population. The more physicians also represents to some extent tertiary education which can show the services a country provides. When people are healthier, generally they live longer, can work longer and people are happier and this affects wellbeing.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Percentage of population with Electricity Access</h3> 
						<p>This measures how many people in the country have access to electricity as a percentage of the total population. Generally the countries with better electricity access are move developed as they can provide better services for their citizens. Electricity is also a basic requirement of life and those with electricity access are generally happier as their lives are easier. Electricity Access is a measure of well being as it indicates the lifestyle of the population.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Population below poverty line</h3> 
						<p>This measures how many people in the country are below the poverty line. The poverty line can be described as the minimum wage to sustain life. As this varies from country to country, some statistics might be different to others. The population below the poverty line is a great indicator to show the gap in the country. The indicator is also extremely important as if someone is below the poverty line their wellbeing is generally very bad as they can’t afford access to water, food and shelter.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Life Expectancy</h3> 
						<p>The life expectancy measures the average number of years a person lives. The life expectancy is an excellent indicator of wellbeing, as the larger the life expectancy the better the health care of a nation, better education and services. A number of direct assumptions and conclusions about the population’s average wellbeing can be drawn from it.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Death Rate per 1000 People</h3> 
						<p>This measures how many people die in a country per every 1000 people. It can be used to identify how healthy a country is and the services that it provides. It is also a useful indicator of the age of the population and can be used to see how many older people there are. </p>
						<hr/>
						<br/>
						<h3>Economic Indicators</h3>
						<br/>
						<h3>GDP / Capita</h3> 
						<p>The GDP per capita measures the total amount of money a country makes divided by its population. This is a helpful indicator in seeing the average income of people in the country. Countries with a higher GDP generally have better well being as they can afford access to services and these countries through tax can provide better services for their citizens like healthcare, education and infrastructure which greatly improve wellbeing.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>GDP By Services</h3> 
						<p>This measures how much of the GDP comes from services. This is a great measure as countries that have more services have much better well being as their citizens are looked after. Services are also great as generally the work is safer and requires more skilled workers. Because the work requires more skilled workers we can gather that the country has a good level of tertiary education which is great for a country's well being.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Minimum Wage in USD</h3> 
						<p>This measures the minimum wage (if any) set by the government in USD. The minimum wage is a great indicator as it can help to assess the strength of a country's government and the support that the government gives to those who don’t have good jobs. The minimum wage also helps to compare countries to one another based upon how much their work is valued by using a common mean (USD).</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Percentage of People Employed in Services</h3> 
						<p>This measures the % of the working population employed in services. This is a great indicator as it helps to reveal the number of people who are educated enough to work in services. Generally you need to have a high level of tertiary education to work in services and this can help to reveal the countries tertiary education level. People who work in services are generally happier as they are working in a specialised field that they commonly enjoy. Working in services is also generally much more safe then working in industry.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Unemployment Rate</h3> 
						<p>The Unemployment rate measures the portion of a population who are unemployed (people actively looking for employment but are currently unemployed). Analysing the unemployment rate can aid in identifying the current state of a country’s economy e.g. If a country is in recession, one can expect a high unemployment rate. The unemployment rate can help unearth the wellbeing of a population because when someone is unemployed, they are not receiving an income, this will ultimately lead to their ‘quality of life’ being affected in a negative manner.</p>

						<h2 id="indexWeighting" class="has-text-centered">Index Weighting</h2>
						<p>
							In the index, I have given everything a weighting. After the data has been collated and ranked they have then been weighted. 
							You can see the weighting at the bottom of my rankings table. Life expectancy, the population below the poverty line and unemployement have all been weighted double compared to the other indicators. They have all been weighted this way as these indicators are important and can give more information about the countries wellbeing.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="width">
						<h2 id="strengths" class="has-text-centered">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
						<p>
							In the index the main strength is diversity. The index takes a wide scope of indicators that all focuss on different areas of wellbeing. All of the indicators give a different perspective and provide great insight into a countries well being. Another strength is that most of the information has been sourced from the CIA Factbook which is a reliable source as it is government run. Most of the data has also been cross-checked with other sources, further supporting the reliablitity of the statistics. 

							<br/><br/>

							Some of the weaknesses could include that some of the statistics come from different years which can through out some of the data. The difference in years can reduce the accuracy of the indicator because it is hard to compare a country
							s data from 2017 to 2013 as generally the countrys change a lot over a period of 5 years. This has been minimised though, and mostly the data is from the same years.
