						<h3>Physicians per 1000 people</h3> 
						<p>This is a measure of how many physicians there are per 1000 people in the country. With more physicians a country generally has better access to doctors and medical treatment which creates a healthier population. The more physicians also represents to some extent tertiary education which represents better wellbeing. When people are healthier, generally they live longer, can work longer and people are happier and this greatly increases wellbeing</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Percentage of population with Electricity Access</h3> 
						<p>This measures how many people in the country have access to electricity as a percentage of the total population. Generally the countries with better electricity access are move developed as they can provide better services for their citizens. Electricity is also a basic requirement of life and those with electricity access are generally happier as their lives are easier. Electricity Access is a measure of well being as it indicates the lifestyle of the population.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Population below poverty line</h3> 
						<p>This measures how many people in the country are below the poverty line as set by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold">The World Bank</a>. This is represented as a percentage of the total population. This indicateds wellbeing by representing the lifestyle of a country.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Life Expectancy</h3> 
						<p>This measures how long people are expected to live in a given country. Generally those who live longer have better health, education and lifestyle which results in better wellbeing.</p>

						In my spare time I enjoy to play a few games, play sport and code random stuff. I enjoy sport and competitively play soccer, (field) hockey and chess (yes its actaully a sport). I am a pretty good hockey and chess player having represented my state in both the sports and have been in the reserve state team for soccer. I have a strong interest in hockey, and since 2015 I have umpired. Last year (2017) I umpired in both the state indoor competition and the U18 div 1 competitons which was fun but challenging at times. 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>
						I am always open to feedback, feedback from people usually makes things better and in my experiance lots of people underrate it! I enjoy a good joke (who doesn't?) and I always try to be entertaining when playing sports, the more exciting it is the more fun eh?

						San Francisco Trip
					</h2>
					<p>
						Recently I went on a school trip traveling to San Francisco and Silicon Valley visiting all the tech companies. Not only did we manage to visit many high-profile companies we were also lucky enough to go inside the companies and get talks from some of the senior people in the companies, for example we got to speak to Dave Hits, the founder of a multi-billion dollar company NetApp. The opportunity was amazing to be able to travel to so many high profile companies,
						and it provided invaluable experiance and insider knowledge. You can read more about it by clicking <a href="blog/sanfran.html">here</a> . I found that being part of such an amazing trip really opened my eyes to be able to see what I am working towards in life.

					<h2 class="title">
						Other Random Stuff
					</h2>
					<p>
						To keep up to date on what I do and a bunch of other stuff, visit my <a href="blog/blog.html">blog</a> page. To chill out and try your luck at my games visit my <a href="tools.html">tools</a> page (yes I know that games arn't really associated with tools, but I couldn't be botherd to put a games link in my menu,
						plus the menu would be too full).
					</p>
					<p>
						New! Check out my tutorials website <a href="http://tutorials.dylanturner.tech">here</a>! It has a lots of cool tutorials on it that I have made myself.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recently I have been doing lots of cool stuff such as helping to run the school swimming carnival score program, learning to hack using buffer overflows, making a visitors app for my school and working on side projects such as the touchbar. I am pretty busiy at the moment, but I find that when you don't play games (which I dont anymore) you have lots of time for other cool things such as coding which is not only much more rewarding but much more beneficial and interesting. Anyways, I better stop blabering on otherwise there will just be too much random un-organised text on this page and I will eventuall have to end up organising it which I just can't really be bothered to do right now :) .
