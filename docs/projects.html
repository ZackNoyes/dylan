			<h1>Time Table App <span class="tag ">iOS App</span></h1>
			<p id="small">Swift App Development - 5/05/2018</p>
			<p>
				After looking on the app store for a while to find a good time table app I couldn't find one. I then decided to make my own timetable app with all the features that I wanted. My timetable app is extremely easy to use - You setup your timetable stating how many days and periods in your cycle, you then set the times for the periods. You can then create classes with custom names, room numbers, descriptions and colors. All you have to do to add a class to your timetable is to select it and tap on the slot in the timetable and it adds it for you! I didn't stop there though. I also needed the ability to quickly see what period is coming up next as well the next & previous period. To solve this I made a widget that based upon the current time it displays the previous, current and next period! Currently all of the processes in the app fully work although I am adding to the user interface to make it easier to use. You can expect to see the app on the app store soon!

				After quite a bit of work the website is now live! You can now send emails using just HTML and customise it quite a bit. Make sure to check out the advanced documentation to see how you can customise it. Form Sender now completly works. Make sure to check it out by pressing view below.

			<h1>Tic Tac Toe App <span class="tag ">iOS App</span></h1>
			<p id="small">iOS App - 23/04/2018</p>
			<p>
				As part of an assignment I have made an iOS app that plays Tic Tac Toe against a computer. The app is much like the javascript version on the website which can be found <a href="tools/tictactoe.html">here.</a> The computer will try to win, block or if none of those two are possible then make a random move. The computer is pretty hard to beat. I may add a download link where you can download the app soon.

			<h1>Form Sender <span class="tag ">Web App</span> <span class="tag ">PHP</span></h1>
			<p id="small">Web App & Development - 22/04/2018</p>
			<p>
				After a while I decided that my contact form just wasn't good enough. Not only did I not use my own code to send any of the forms but I also had to send my users to do externall re-caphcas which wasn't great. I then did some research into how to make my own email form sending service and with that I did. I made Form Sender, a complete email sending service that works on static websites, with as many inputs as you want and can be sent to any email. Sadly the website isn't live for public use as I have to work out how to prevent abuse of the platform and users sending scam emails through it. I hope to make the service live soon but I also require good email hosting that will let me send unlimited emails. The service is much better than its nearest competitiors as it doesn't re-direct your viewers anywhere and can be used for any type of form.

			<p id="small">Chat Room - 7/04/2018</p>
			<p>Recently I created a chat room using google's <a href="www.firebase.com">Firebase</a>. The app works like a message room or group chat. You can log into the chat room by using a google account as I have enabled google authentication. When you log in, your google picture and name is used in the chat room. As the chat room is fairly new, I am working on adding an active users box, so you can see who else is active as well adding stastistics. Note that the app is still in beta, and is not complete.

			<p>
				I have continued to add some cool updates to my website to make it even more sleek. On the homepage, there is no longer the scrappy projects part, it has now been replaced by nice tiles each featuring a small description of a project. I have also further updated the homepage with the "Blog Hexagon's" which show images of some of the blog images and when hovered on display a description and link to the blog page. I am also currently upgrading the website so that it can be https. Also, you may have noticed that on the tutorials website I have included comments, I have also rolled out the comments onto my blog page and I am looking to do so with some of the tools as well. More updates to come!

				I have decided to create a new website just for tutorials. The website is currently under development but looking pretty good, if you would like to get a sneak peak you can visit it <a href="http://tutorials.dylanturner.tech">here</a>. The website is aimed to give tutorials on things that are pretty hard to find on the internet, but are also super usefull in everyday coding. If you ahve any suggestions on how the website should look please contact me. Also if you have any ideas on tutorials that I could write please contact me.

			<h1>Website Updates<span class="tag ">Website Development</span></h1>
			<p id="small">Website Updates - 23/02/2018</p>
			<p>
				I have added many updates to my website. Firstly in the <a href="tools/tools.html">tools</a> part of my website there is now a collapsable side menu. You can access this menu by selecting any tool, and down the bottom right hand side there will be a button with "Show Menu" on it. Click the button and a minature version of the menu will scroll in from the side allowing you to access any tool from any tool page without having to go back to the tools homepage. I suggest you check it out as it is pretty cool. Other updates include changes and fixes to the menu's, for example the footer didn't display correctly on the blog page, and some of the Menu's were in consistent. There were also many other consistency updates, with buttons and notifications updated across the website. <br/>
				<br/>
				In the works are some other new features such as making a new website just for tutorials which should be coming soon! The website for tutorials will have many code tutorials aimed at being able to be learnt by anyone. The website will also have information about how to optimise websites and hints. Also I will be updating the look of the <a href="tools/touchbar.html">Touch Bar App</a> page to make it easier to read and wider.

			<h1>Pong - Update <span class="tag ">App</span></h1>
			<p id="small">Updated Pong App - 12/01/2018</p>
			<p>
				I have added quite a few tweaks to my Pong app to make it better and easier to use! The updates include fixing the bouncing, user interface upgrades and better customiseablity. Now whenever the ball bounces on a paddle, depending on where the ball hits on the paddle the 
				ball will bounce off at different angles, making the game more like the origional version. For example if the ball hits the edge of the paddle, the ball will go off at a shallower angle whilst if the ball hits the middle it will go straight. The app also now has a much better 
				user interface, and displays better on all devices. The app is still not Ipad compatible but it now works on any iphone size. The app also has more customizability, you can set the speed that the paddles move at, you can make the paddles move slowly or fast to ajust how hard you want to make it. Soon I will add more 
				settings such as paddle color, paddle design, paddle size and ball speed. If you have any suggestions let me know by contacting me. You can also now see a demo of my app in action by pressing the view button!

			<p id="small">A javascript game - 22/12/2017</p>
			<p>
				Random Products is currently a unique Beta game. The game selects a random product from a list and then pixelises the image. The job of the user is to guess what the product is. If you guess the product incorrectly, the image becomes less pixleised and easier to guess but you get less points. If you guess incorrectly 3 times, you lose a life and you have 
				three lives in the game. The game is currently not hosted anywhere although I intend to host it when I add more products.

There are easy and hard words and as you level up you get more hard words. As you level up the speed of new words and the speed of the words moving down the page increases. 
				When I next update the game it will include the ability to have your own custom word lists to play with and I will add more words to the defualt list. The game can be used to practice spelling, learn new words and to practice your typing speed!
