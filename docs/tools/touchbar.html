				Please note that this app is in Beta, and there are a few known issues.
					<ul>
						<li>When you quit the app, you must fully quit it, by going to the icon in the bottom bar. Otherwise it won't start.</li>
						<li>The application only works whilst the window is active, its not really my fault - apple places restrictions.</li>

				<h2 class="title">About</h2>
				<blockquote>
					The touch bar app randomly spams colors on your touchbar after clicking the "Party" button. You can stop the flashing colors by pressing the "Stop" button.
				</blockquote>
				<p> Below you can see the start button as it appears on the touchbar: <br/> <br/>
					<img src="touchbarstart.png"/>
					<br/>
					Here is what it looks like in action, There is a bar of color which changes rapidly: 
					<br/><br/>
					<img src="touchbaractive.png"/>
					<br/>
					I made this app, because I thought that the touchbar is really under-used and there is hardly ever any colors on the touchbar. I then thought, why not make something cool that I would use, and then share it with others. In the future I will be looking to make the app customiseable with editable color lists as well as fixing up the few issues. I would also love to make it that it is permanent to the touchbar so that when you aren't activly on the window you can still use it. I can't really see any way around this though as Apple has made it that each application has access to the middle area of the touchbar only whilst active.
